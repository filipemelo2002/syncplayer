### Overview
This project is part of my studies about Nodejs, Electron and ordinary Desktop development. SyncPlayer is a desktop media player which provides to you a beautiful and neat interface, and also the ability to connect to someone's Syncplayer, allowing to synchronize your players' controls. It is achieved due to the backend server that is connected throught Websocket protocols.

## Features

* 📎 synchronize your player to somebody else's
* 🎥 load local video files (.mkv not avaliable)
* 📄 load local .srt or vtt subtitles
* 💻 control both players at the same time
* ⌨️ Keyboard actions sychronized

## Coming up soon
* Verification if the files were loaded
* Friend list to quickly connect
* More keyboard shortcuts
